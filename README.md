# Fruits

Fruits is a simple list and detail app contains 12 fruits inside the app created using JSON.

## Background

This app is created based on own design with 60%, 30%, and 10% color rule, which I call Shade, Tone, and Tint, and monochromatic color scheme, so I use dark gray, gray, and light gray.
